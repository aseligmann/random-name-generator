# Random Name Generator

A Python-based random name generator that creates unique, compound names by combining adjectives and nouns from different categories.

Example names:

```text
instant-sweet-salsa
little-plain-beer
agile-champagne-fowl
quick-salty-mousse
giant-red-swift
wide-chalky-recipe
spry-salty-yeast
long-mild-butterkase
medium-dry-citron
miniature-scared-bush
```

## Features

- Generates unique compound names using multiple word categories
- Combines adjectives (size, speed, taste, colors, emotions, character) with nouns (foods, animals, plants, cheese)
- Produces hyphen-separated names
- Removes duplicates automatically
- Outputs results to a text file

## Development

* Use `uv` and `pre-commit` to manage virtual environments and pre-commit hooks
